# JAX_Examples
Simple examples of linear algebra, probability, statistics and MLE using JAX (autograd) language in Python.

This repository (currently) consists of four simple Jupyter Notebooks, illustrating the use of JAX for:
- Linear Algebra
- Random Number Generation
- Automatic Differentiation
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation

We are primarily interesting in demonstrating/exploring the use of Automatic Differentiation via JAX (in Python) for use in core statistical inferential problems. The repository is rather primitive, and we plan to add more examples as they become available.
